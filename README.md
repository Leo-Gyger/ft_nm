# ft_nm

This repository is my attempt at recreating the nm function from LLVM.


##Behaviour

nm shows you the symbol table and their attributes from an executable,
for example an a.out file. The output shows the difference between a function,
and a pointer on said function. In short it maps the functions and
variables in a program.
